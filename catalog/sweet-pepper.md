*Sweet peppers come originally from South and Central America and belong to the Solanaceae (nightshade) family.*

##Qualities 
 
- The various varieties of sweet pepper differ greatly in color, shape and size. Sweet peppers are often green or red in color, but sometimes also yellow, white, purple or black. 
- The pungent flavor of the sweet pepper is derived from the alkaloid capsaicin. However, the capsaicin content of sweet peppers is not very high, so their flavor is quite mild. 
- The skin of the sweet pepper must be in perfect condition, with no spots, injuries or signs that it is drying out or starting to spoil.
