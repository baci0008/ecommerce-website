<h1>About Tutti Fruitree</h1>
<p>Tutti Fruitree is Canada's #1 organic and local food website. We maintain a definitive and reliable "living" public nationwide directory of small farms, farmers markets, and other local food sources. Our search engine helps people find products from family farms, local sources of sustainably grown food, and encourages them to establish direct contact with small farms in their local area. Our online store helps small farms develop markets for some of their products beyond their local area.</p>

<p>The richness, variety, and flavor of our communities, food systems, and diets is in jeopardy. The exclusive focus on economic efficiency has brought us low prices and convenience through large supermarkets chains, agribusiness and factory farms, while taking away many other aspects of our food lives, like our personal relation with our food and with the people who produce it. More and more people are realizing this and actively working to turn the tide and to preserve a food industry based on family-owned, small scale businesses. They are our best guarantee against a world of styrofoam-like long-shelf-life tomatoes and diets dictated from corporate boardrooms.</p>

<p>The Buy Local movement is quickly taking us beyond the promise of environmental responsibility that the organic movement delivered, and awakening Canada to the importance of community, variety, humane treatment of farm animals, and social and environmental responsibility in regards to our food economy.</p>

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>Tutti Fruitree was founded in 1998, and is now the number one informational resource for the Buy Local movement and the top place on the Internet where people find information on direct marketing family farms. We now have more than 20000 members, and are growing by about 20 new members every day. Through our servers, our website and those of our partners serve about three and a half million page views per month to the public interested in buying food from family farms.
Tutti Fruitree is located in Ottawa, Canada, and was founded by David Smith, a software engineer and activist dedicated to generating positive social change through the Internet.</p>
